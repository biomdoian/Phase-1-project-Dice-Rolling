# Project Dice Rolling Fun!

Hey there! Welcome to my simple but fun dice rolling web app. It is designed to simulate the roll of two dice, and hopefully, to brighten up your day or mood.

# The Content

* Two Rolling Dice: Watch as two colorful dice images spin and land on random numbers.
* Total Roll Display: The sum of your dice roll, plus the individual dice values.
* Fun Messages: Get a little cheer  messages like "Hurry!" for a 6, and "Wow!" for doubles.
* Cool Animations: Enjoy smooth spinning, a subtle "shake" on the roll, and a button pulse effect.

# How to Use It

1.  Open the Page: Just open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
2.  Click the Button: Click the "Roll Dice" button to see the magic happen!
3.  Enjoy the Roll: Watch the dice spin and see your results.
